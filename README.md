# Practice

I use this repository to store my practice for coding questions. Right now, for most of it, I only includes the function without main() or test features.

I also want to put some of my old projects in here for reference.

_3/12/2017_: 
Create two folder for problems I got from CodeFight and LeetCode so that it is more managable.  
Add 3 new problems from leetcode.com:   
    TwoSum  	
    AddTwoNumber  
    LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacter  

_My code might not be the best one out there, but they are authentic and original._
