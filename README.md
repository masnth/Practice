# Practice

I use this repository to store my practice for coding questions. Right now, for most of it, I only includes the function without main() or test features.

I also want to put some of my old projects in here for reference.

I have been busy with my new job for a while,
mostly learning SQL server with C#, but I am 
planning to practice again soon.

_My code might not be the best one out there, but they are authentic and original._
