# Practice

I use this repository to store my practice for coding questions. Right now, for most of it, I only includes the function without main() or test features.

I also want to put some of my old projects in here for reference.

_12/3/2017_:   
Create two folder for problems I got from CodeFight and LeetCode so that it is more managable.  
Add 3 new problems from leetcode.com:    
    TwoSum  
    AddTwoNumber  
    LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacter  

_12/4/2017_:  
Add 2 new problems:  
	ReverseInteger  
	isNumberPalindrome  

_12/6/2017_:  
Add 3 new problems:  
	CountingBits  
	MaximumBinaryTree  
	SingleElementSortedArray  
	
_12/8/2017_:
Add 1 new problem:
	FindBottomLeftTreeValue
	
_12/11/2017_:
Create new folder _Database_ in LeetCode folder  
Add 4 new Database problems:  
	DuplicateEmail

_My code might not be the best one out there, but they are authentic and original._
