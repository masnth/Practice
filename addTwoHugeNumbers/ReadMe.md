You're given 2 huge integers represented by linked lists. Each linked list element is a number from 0 to 9999 that represents a number with exactly 4 digits. The represented number might have leading zeros. Your task is to add up these huge integers and return the result in the same format.

Example:
	For a = [9876, 5432, 1999] and b = [1, 8001], the output should be
	addTwoHugeNumbers(a, b) = [9876, 5434, 0].
	9987654321999 + 18001 = 987654340000.
