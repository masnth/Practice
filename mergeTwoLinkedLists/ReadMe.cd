Given a linked list l, reverse its nodes k at a time and return the modified list. k is a positive integer that is less than or equal to the length of l. If the number of nodes in the linked list is not a multiple of k, then the nodes that are left out at the end should remain as-is.
You may not alter the values in the nodes - only the nodes themselves can be changed.

The program should run in O(n) time and use O(1) memory.

Example 
 For l1 = [1, 1, 2, 4] and l2 = [0, 3, 5], the output should be
 mergeTwoLinkedLists(l1, l2) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
